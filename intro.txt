KAIVALYA 2022
THINK! DESIGN! DEVELOP!

Geographically, we are located amidst the hills of North India. To some, we might merely be a
valley in the Himalayas but we speak Technology. We are the Coding Club of BTKIT Dwarahat,
Uttarakhand and we proudly present Kaivalya 2022.
Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Institute of Technology, Dwarahat is a Technical Institute of Uttarakhand
Government that is situated near the hills of District Almora. “Kaivalya” is the annual technical
fest organized by the Coding Club of BTKIT Dwarahat which is supported by BTKIT IEEE
Student Branch.
After the grand success and the overwhelming response to “Kaivalya 2014, 2015, 2018,2019”,
the only option we had was to make it bigger and better without compromising the convenience
of participation and we have focussed on doing exactly that. All the major events of Kaivalya
2022 will be hosted online and will be free to participate. The rewards have become more
exciting and the challenges more promising. The speciality with Kaivalya 2022 is that we, the
organizers, not only treat it as an event for you to interact with us but also for us to mingle up
with you. In fact, it all started as a dream, and it eventually has become a community.
“Kaivalya 2022” is scheduled to be organized in the mid of April 2022. For the convenience of
anyone in the world to participate, we have made the major events of Kaivalya including the
signature event “Gambit” online. The minor events will however be conducted only onsite.
With exciting prizes and no participation fees, and the convenience of participating just with an
internet connection from anywhere in the world, you have nothing to lose. So, find the event that
suits you the most, enroll yourself and gear up, because the challenges are only going to get
better and harder.
